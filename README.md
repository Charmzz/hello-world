Hi All,

Without formal education in IT and coding, I try to make time outside of work to learn and hopefully make a better habit of applying this new learning around IDEs, Source Control tools, server configurations, DBA activities and programming languages.  Working amongst very talented and knowlegeable folks in these respective areas has been the largest inspiriation in my adult life and I aspire to further my own know-how and application of these practices.  I could argue that I was largely raised on a PC by the likes of Doom, C&C and more. my daily life and social structures have largely been built on a foundation of games and at this point, feel the need to pull every thread to know how it all works.

This is my mission statement.
